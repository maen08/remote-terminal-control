# remote-terminal-control

#### Send Linux commands to a remote PC(or server) from WhatsApp with Twilio
You can learn from this project, going further and build something tremendous! From the concept of this project (of-course you need to improve and add few other things) you can:

- Deploy your docker replicas just by sending WhatsApp text
- You can monitor your IoT devices remotely
- Send commands to your K8's engine for some orchestration processes

In fact you can do alot, the sky is not a limit :) Let's setup our project.
